 Instructions:

 If you are familiar with MTG or similar games than this logic will make sense to you. Same same, but simpler (No abilities or spells).

 Each player starts with 20HP (Health).

 The goal of the game is to take your opponent (Jimbo or Doofenshmirtz) down to zero health.

 Jimbo is the easier AI, Doofenschmirtz is the harder AI. (Yes it is actually harder)

 The game starts with each player being handed a shuffled deck of 40 cards. Each player then draws 7 cards.

 The game will happen in phase starting with your opponent.

 How the cards work:
 - To play or attack with a card when prompted, you must type in the ID of the card located at the bottom left of each card.
 - Make sure you are picking the card from the correct location. Cards above the "YOUR BATTLEFIELD" text with arrows pointing up are the cards you can attack with.
   Note: The game will prompt you where to choose from.
 - Your cards strength and toughness are located at the bottom right of your card. The number to the right of the letter is your cards STRENGTH and TOUGHNESS I.E(S:4 T:5).
 - If you are attacked by a card with S:6  T:6, and you blocked with the example above, your card would be destroyed, and you would be dealt 1 damage:
   for example the enemies card is (S:6 T:6) and mine is (S:4 T:5) then the enemies S:6 - my cards T:5 = 1 damage dealt to me.
   Note: If the enemies blocking card strength is the same or greater than your cards defense, even if you are attacking, your card will be destroyed to. However, only the enemy will take the damage.
 - Your battlefield and the enemies battlefield are seperated by a divider, I.E. "---------------------"

 Each player turn happens in a sequence of:
 - You will have the choice to attack IF you have cards on your battlefield. If you or your opponent choose to attack, you will be offered the choice to block.
   Note: Obviously this will be skipped the first turn. No one starts with cards on the battlefield.
 - If a choice was made to block, the game will calculate the difference of your cards in strength or toughness and deal the damage accordingly.
 - Your battlefield is indicated by the big letters saying "YOUR BATTLEFIELD" with arrows above it, pointing to any cards you have played.
   Note: this is simulating the "table" in front of you.
 - After the Attack phase above is finished, you or your opponent will be able to play a card from your hand, to the battlefield.
 - The cards in your hand are the cards above the big letters "YOUR HAND". You CANNOT attack with these cards, they are in your "hand".
   Note: This is simulating you holding the cards in your hand, like any other card game.
 - You cannot see the AI's hand and the AI cannot see your hand.
 - After you have played a card, IF you have cards left in your deck you will draw a card from your randomly shuffled deck.
 - Be aware, you cannot play more than 7 cards to the battlefield at one time. If you did not play a card because your battlefield was full, you will not draw a card.
 - The game will now rinse and repeat, THERE CAN ONLY BE ONE!

 GOOD LUCK AND WE HOPE YOU ENJOY!!!
